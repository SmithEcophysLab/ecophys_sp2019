# Grading rubric for final deliverable
As mentioned in the syllabus,
the primary semester project will be to produce a deliverable. 
Broadly, the deliverable should answer a question or solve a problem related 
to plant ecophysiology.
This deliverable could be a literature review, proposal, research project, podcast, 
outreach project, etc. 
The deliverable will be assessed for completeness, breadth, originality,scientific rigor 
and presentation.
The description and scoring for each of these components is laid out below.

## Structure
**All projects must include a cover page with the title, authors, and 
a statement defining the intended audience.**

**All projects must include a one-page summary of the project that
includes a statement of the problem or question addressed, the method it was
addressed, and a statement of the main conclusions from the project.**

In all cases literature must be cited in a consistent format. Please use peer-reviewed
literature articles. Non-peer-reviewed literature may be used under select circumstances,
but only if a peer-reviewed article cannot be used in its place.

The structure of the rest of the deliverable will be dependent on the project-type.
Below are suggested structures for different project types. Alternate structures
are allowed. However, please consult with Dr. Smith if you plan to do a different 
structure.

### Research Projects
Research projects should be structured as literature articles with
an Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion sections.
The Introduction should clearly outline the problem using past studies and present
a testable hypothesis. Methods should state the research performed to test the
hypothesis. The Results should clearly state the primary findings of the study
in relation to the hypotheses tested. 
The Results sections should include figures and/or tables presenting the results.
The Discussion should indicate how the results compare to previous findings and
the larger implications of the results.

### Research Proposals
Research proposals should be developed around a central question or hypothesis.
The question or hypothesis should be developed from previous literature
and that literature should be cited in an introductory section that provides
the background for why the question is important, necessary, and novel.
Following the introduction, a section should detail how the project will be performed,
including how data will be acquired and analyzed. Figures and diagrams may be used
to help the reader visualize various aspects of the  proposal, including, 
but not limited to, the hypotheses or experimental design.

### Literature reviews
Literature reviews should address a single question or problem. The documents should
thoroughly review the scientific studies done to address this question/problem as well
as document any gaps in the literature that may deserve further attention. A successful
review will pull together multiple research areas and present the findings around a
central theme as a way to guide future research. Important terms may be defined in 
a glossary and important concepts may be fleshed out in boxes. Conceptual diagrams and
figures may be useful. Note that these can be redrawn from other articles provided that
proper citation is given.

### Podcast (or similar orally disseminated product)
An orally disseminated deliverable, such as a podcast, will follow a similar format to
a written project and will depend on the way the question or problem is addressed 
(e.g., through literature review or through primary research).
The product should clearly lay out the problem or question being addressed,
method that it was addressed, and answers (or potential answers) to the problem or 
question. The product should follow a logical flow and be formatted clearly.

### Outreach project (or similar community engagement project)
An outreach project should address a problem or question relating to plant ecophysiology.
The bulk of the project will constitute a tool or event designed to involve
individuals of a defined audience type in the stated problem or question.
Students should build the tool or perform the event and develop a short write-up
describing the product produced.

## Grading Rubric (100 points total)

### Completeness (30 points)
The deliverable begins with a logical introduction that includes a statement of the
problem or question asked. The main portion of the deliverable address the problem
or question. The deliverable ends with an answer to the problem or question, or a 
path to address the problem or question. The audience must be convinced that the
problem is important and was (or can be) addressed.

### Breadth and Originality (20 points)
The deliverable is sufficiently broad to address an outstanding question in the field
of plant physiological ecology. The deliverable should can combine known ideas to form
a new idea, but must not be a simple reiteration of known facts.

### Scientific rigor (30 points)
The deliverable should be grounded in sound science. The product should not contain false
or ambiguous claims. Products answering questions should do so using hypothesis-based
analysis. All unoriginal facts and figures should be correctly cited.

### Presentation (20 points)
The deliverable should be presented in a clear, concise manner appropriate for the
defined audience. All written documents should use proper English grammar and notation
appropriate for the deliverable type. All figures and images should be clearly presented
with all elements fully defined.
