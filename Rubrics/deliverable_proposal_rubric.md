# Grading rubric for deliverable proposal
The purpose of the deliverable proposal is to present your idea to the class
as a way to receive feedback and, ultimately, improve your project.
This will involve a short, written idea for the proposal that will be turned
in to Dr. Smith. Students will also present their idea to class.
This presentation will be ~5 minutes and there will be a few minutes for questions
from the class.

**Note:** The presentation and written document must clearly indicate the ecological and
physiological aspects of the project.
