# Jasper Ridge Hypotheses

## Biomass
- Increase in shoot biomass with *N addition*, but not roots because more roots are not needed to get
N
- More biomass under *full manipulation* because of lowered resource
limitation and low effect of temperature
- More biomass under *added N* in C3 plants because of reduced N limitation
- More biomass under *increased precipitation*, particularly above ground
because of reduced water limitation
- Increase in shoot, relative to root, biomass under *elevated CO2* because of increased
allocation to photosynthesis
- More shoot, relative to root, biomass under *full manipulation* due to increased
competition for aboveground resources

## Diversity
- Reduced diversity with *N addition* because of greater competition for other resources (x3)
- Reduced diversity under *all treatments* but for different reasons
	- *CO2 & N*: reduced limitations taken advantage by few species (x2)
	- *All conditions*: acclimation speed faster in some species than others


## Leaf Photosynthesis
- Progressively increase with more added resources (CO2 & N) because of lowered resource
limitation

## Leaf N
- No change under elevated CO2 and N addition because of counterbalancing effects
(i.e., CO2 decrease and N increase)
