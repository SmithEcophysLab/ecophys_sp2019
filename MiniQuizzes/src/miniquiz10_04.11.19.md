**2. Explain Grime's Competitive-Stress Tolerant-Ruderal (C-S-R) plant strategy scheme? 
Under what type of environments does each strategy thrive?**

\pagebreak

**3. Pick an ecosystem. How might global change shift the C-S-R makeup in that ecosystem?**

\pagebreak

**4. Two decades after Grime's paper, Mark Westoby proposed a new plant strategy matrix based 
on leaf size (SLA), plant height, and seed mass call the leaf-height-seed
framework, or L-H-S. This is comparable to the C-S-R framework
in that SLA describes the competition-stress tolerance axis and height and seed mass
describe different ways to deal with disturbance (i.e., the R axis). 
Explain how SLA could be related to the C-S axis and how height and seed mass could be related 
to the R axis.**

**5. What might be some positive or negatives of the L-H-S framework as compared to
the C-S-R framework?**
