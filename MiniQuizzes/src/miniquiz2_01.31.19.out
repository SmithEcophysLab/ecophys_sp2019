\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.4}{Von Caemmerer and Farquhar performed their experiments using Phaseolus vulgaris, or common bean. This species is a leguminous \(i.e., nitrogen fixing\) species with C3 photosynthesis. Do you think their experiments would have turned out differently using a different species? If so, how?}{}% 4
