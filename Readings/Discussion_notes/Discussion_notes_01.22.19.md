Chapin (2003). Effects of plant traits on ecosystem and regional processes:
a conceptual framework for predicting the consequences of global change. 
*Annals of Botany* **91**: 455-463.

## Discussion
Main points from the paper
* Global change is happening
* Plant feedbacks are important
	* Need to consider biodiversity (functional diversity?)
* Figure 1
	* State factors vs. interactive controls
	* Plants drive ecosystem processes through interactive controls
* Interactive controls
	* Resource supply
	* Modulators (biophysics)
	* Disturbance
	* Species interactions
	* Humans
* Integrated effects
	* NPP -- what is this??
	* Soil processes
	* Atmospheric processes
	* Disturbance
* Landscape and regional processes
	* Teleconnections

Additional items for discussion
* GPP/NPP/NEP
	* If NEP is negligible, why should we care (but see: 
	[Keenan et al., 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13428))
* Any other topics/terms we need to review?
