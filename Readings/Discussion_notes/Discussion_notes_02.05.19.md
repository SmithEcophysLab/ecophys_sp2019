# Some questions that arose for the discussion of Boardman (1977)

Weston:
- Which requires more nutrients in order to survive the sun or shade species?

Carson:
- The paper took note that in these analyses that light-saturation was considered 
independent of light absorption efficiency. How would these findings change if they were 
to consider them as dependent on one another? Would adding that element complicate things, 
make it to complex to analyze these relationships, or would it not really have an affect 
on their findings?

Matt:
- Would certain species, such as those from environments with greater chances of light 
regime disturbance, have higher degrees of plasticity when compared to species that are 
less likely to experience these disturbances?

Nan:
- I believe that the shade plants adapted to the low light environment is due to the 
evasion of taking the same niches as sun plants do. Thus, except the light condition, 
are there any other strategy that shade plants do for avoiding competition?

James:
- If leaf morphology and chloroplast structure (density) indicate sun species have larger 
thicker leaves, why have shade species not evolved and adapted to having thicker/larger 
leaves with higher capacities for chloroplasts to capture more light? Could this be a 
function of shade species traits inherently having a genetic component limiting 
carboxylase activity, thus it wouldn’t be an advantage to have thicker leaves because 
that is more limiting than having a higher capacity for light saturation?

Leah:
- What are “low compensation points”?

Evan:
- What would we expect to see if sun and shade plants were grown in high light, high 
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations? 
How might this impact RuBP carboxylase activity?
