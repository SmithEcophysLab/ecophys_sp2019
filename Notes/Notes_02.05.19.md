# Notes for class on February 5, 2019

## Objectives
* Discuss physiological responses to light
* Discuss variations in light environments in ecological systems
* Examine the difference between instantaneous, acclimation, and adaptation responses to 
light availability, including differences in plant traits

## Agenda
1. Lecture - **The ecophysiological consequences of light variability**
	- [Link to lecture slides](../Lecture_slides/02.05.19_light.pdf)
2. Hypotheses about plant trait variation in response to different light environments
	- [Link to CANTRIP database](https://github.com/trevorkeenan/traitPlasticity)
3. Discussion of Boardman (1977)
4. Deliverable brainstorm (who's got ideas?!?)

## Homework
* Read Niinemets et al. (2015). The full citation and link can be found in the 
[Readings](../Readings) folder. The pdf can be found on BlackBoard.
* Continue thinking about your deliverable idea!
What types of interesting questions could you ask with the available trait databases/sets?
