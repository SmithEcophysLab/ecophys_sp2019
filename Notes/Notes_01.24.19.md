# Notes for class on January 24, 2019

## Objectives
* Discuss plant traits and their relation to ecophysiology
* Learn about large-scale plant trait research

## Agenda
1. Discuss [user_guide.md](../user_guide.md)
2. Mini-quiz, including TPS and discussion
3. Time for followup discussion of Chapin (2003) (see point below)
4. Discussion of Reich (2014) (Lead: Nick)
	- [Discussion slides](../Readings/Discussion_slides/week1_Reich2014.pdf)
5. Introduction to plant trait databases/sets
	- [In class slides](../Tools/trait_data/accessing_trait_data.pdf)

## Undiscussed points from Chapin (2003)
Paraphrased from questions turned in:
- NPP: What is it and, if NPP is unaffected by climate, 
why should we care about climate? (Jenna, Carson)
- Is there a benefit to being small, growing less, 
or having slower metabolism? (Carson)
- Are there cases where being small, growing less, 
or having slower metabolism impacts ecosystem processes? (Evan)
- If (burning) fossil fuels are so bad, 
then why is there a booming oil market now? (Madison)

## Homework
* Read Von Caemmerer and Farquhar (1981). The full citation and link can be found in the 
[Readings](../Readings) folder.
* Start thinking about your deliverable idea. 
What types of interesting questions could you ask with the available trait databases/sets?
