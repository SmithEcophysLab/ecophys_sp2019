why should we care about climate? (Jenna, Carson)
- Is there a benefit to being small, growing less, 
or having slower metabolism? (Carson)
- Are there cases where being small, growing less, 
or having slower metabolism impacts ecosystem processes? (Evan)
- If (burning) fossil fuels are so bad, 
then why is there a booming oil market now? (Madison)
